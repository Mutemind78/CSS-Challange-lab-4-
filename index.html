            <p> My self Harsh Patel, born and raised in village named Vatadra which is located in the central part of
                Gujarat in India. Later, at the age of 6, I was admitted to the school which was about 15kms away from
                my village. My school name was Supath E.M.H.S located near the Gulf of Cambay. I studied their for 14
                years, from Playgroup to 12th grade. I use stay in top 5 rankings every year of my schooling. Afterall,
                before entering to the important years of my schooling i.e 11th and 12th grade, I decided to pursue my
                further studies in Canada after completing my 12th Grade. And, I made it scuccessfully.... I completed
                my 12th grade with 81%, later, I started preparing of IELTS to move 1 step ahead towards my goals. And
                again I cracked it. And finally I am here to complete my further studies..
